# Assignment 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

This project shows how I cleaned a messy dataset using Python.

## Project Files

- **messy_data.csv**: My messy dataset.
- **cleaned_data.csv**: My final cleaned data.
- **Scripts/data_preprocessor.py**: My Python file with cleaning functions.
- **Scripts/main.ipynb**: My notebook where I tested and cleaned the data.

## What I Did

- I filled missing values.
- I removed duplicate rows.
- I changed numbers to be between 0 and 1 (normalized).
- I removed columns that looked too similar.

## How to Run

1. Open `Scripts/main.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run each part to see how I cleaned the data.
3. The final cleaned data is saved in `cleaned_data.csv`.

I learned how to clean data step by step!
